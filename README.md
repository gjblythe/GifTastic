# GifTastic

This app interfaces with the Giphy API to append static images from JSON responses using AJAX to the DOM.

15 buttons are generated in Javascript then appended to the index.html

CLick any button to load 10 gifs from Giphy.
    
Each of these 10 images have a click handler that will start and stop animation by changing it's URL and toggle between fixed and animated.

User can enter a custom button. 
First the user enters the text they would like to search in Giphy then clicking the You Choose button.
Once created this button will append to the list of generated buttons.
It will function in the same fashion, generating 10 images and allowing a toggle between fixed and animated.
